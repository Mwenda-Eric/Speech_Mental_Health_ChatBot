      "\n",
      "1. Communicate openly and honestly: It's important to talk to your friends and express how you are feeling. Be honest and use \"I\" statements to avoid accusatory language. Let them know how their behavior is affecting you.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Listen to their perspective: Communication is a two-way street. Listen to what your friends have to say and try to understand their feelings and perspective. This can help you see the situation from their point of view and find common ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Identify the problem: Work together to identify the root cause of the problem. Is it a misunderstanding, jealousy, or a difference in opinions? Understanding the underlying issue can help find a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Seek a mediator: If you are having trouble communicating and resolving the issues on your own, consider reaching out to a trusted mutual friend or a counselor to help mediate the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Take responsibility: Reflect on your own actions and see if you might have contributed to the problem. Taking responsibility for your actions and apologizing can help mend the friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Set boundaries: If the issue is ongoing and you are feeling emotionally drained, it's important to set boundaries with your friends. Let them know what behaviors are not acceptable to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Know when to let go: If the friendship is causing you more harm than good and the issues cannot be resolved, it's okay to walk away. Sometimes it's best to let go of toxic relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, friendships can go through ups and downs, and it's important to communicate and work through the challenges together. However, it's also important to prioritize your own well-being and know when it's best to distance yourself from unhealthy relationships. Take care of yourself and surround yourself with people who uplift and support you.\n",
